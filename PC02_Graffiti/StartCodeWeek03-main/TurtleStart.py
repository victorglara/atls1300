'''

import turtle # import the library of commands that you'd like to use
turtle.colormode(255) # so you can use standar RGB values, 0-255

#Create a panel to draw on. 
win = Screen()
w = 700 # width of panel
h = 700 # height of panel
win.setup(width=w, height=h) #700 x 700 is a decent size to work on. 
#You can experiment by making it the size of your screen or super tiny!

#====================================================== Your code ======================================================




#======= Clean up, required to run properly ======
turtle.done() # nothing should come after this line of code!
