# Starter Code - Week03
Welcome to Github! This platform will be used to share files with each other in the class. 

[Turtle Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) Use the docs!

This week, we'll be drawing on images. When working with images, the file has to be in the same folder as your script (.py file).
**You must make sure all images you reference in the code is in the same folder as your script!**

In this repository currently has 1 file:
- TurtleStart.py - starter code for MP02 and general Turtle shenanigans. Always save as after opening!
**FOR PC02 - Ada Version**
- FullAda_Glam.gif - A photo of Ada Lovelace
- JustAda_Glam.gif - Another photo of Ada Lovelace
- AdaStart.py - starter code for PC02. **Always save as after opening!**
- _(Folder)_ Extra_Images - Contains 2 gif images for optional use in the assignment. **You will have to move these images to the same folder that contains AdaStart.py in order for your code to work.** Instructions to add the images will not be provided. You can use pattern recognition to copy relevant stater code lines, or use the docs!
- _(Folder)_ PC02-Selfie - Contains two .py files needed for the *harder* version of this assignment. Please follow instructions on the Canvas link to use properly. _Note: Windows computers may have install issues with pygame_
